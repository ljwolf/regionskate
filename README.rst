regionskate
========================

This region aims to provide a fast, simple implementation of the SKATER spatial regionalization algorithm based on spanning tree pruning. 

The module depends on scikit-learn, scipy, numpy, and pysal.

**This has been merged into [pysal/region](https://github.com/pysal/region), but this will remain a single-class wrapper around the `Spanning_Forest` clusterer.**
